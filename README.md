# AWS Infrastructure Architecture and Components
## Overview
This README provides an in-depth overview of our AWS infrastructure architecture, highlighting the key components, their interactions, and how they work together to establish a secure, scalable, and reliable cloud environment. Our architecture leverages various AWS services and tools to meet our operational and security requirements.

## Components
### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Our AWS infrastructure is built within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), providing network isolation and segmentation. The VPC contains multiple subnets:

- Public Subnets: These host resources that require direct internet access, such as load balancers and jump hosts.
- Private Subnets: These house internal resources like application servers and databases, which should not be directly accessible from the internet.

### EC2 Instances
We have deployed multiple EC2 instances to cater to different needs:

- Windows Server: Running Windows-based applications.
- Linux Server: Hosting Linux-based services.

### Proxy Server
A proxy server is deployed to enhance security and manage outbound internet traffic for both Windows and Linux servers. This server ensures that only authorized traffic is allowed and helps protect against potential threats.

## VPN (Virtual Private Network)
Our architecture includes a VPN connection to securely connect on-premises infrastructure to our VPC. This allows secure communication and data transfer between the two environments.

## Amazon S3 Buckets
We use Amazon S3 buckets to store various types of data, including backups, logs, and static assets. Access controls are defined using AWS IAM roles to ensure data security.

## AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
AWS IAM is central to our security strategy. We create IAM users, groups, and roles to manage access to AWS resources. Least privilege principles are followed, granting only the necessary permissions.

## AWS CloudTrail
AWS CloudTrail captures API calls and logs related to our AWS account. This aids in auditing, compliance monitoring, and detecting unauthorized activities.

## Wazuh Integration
We've integrated Wazuh, an open-source security monitoring platform, into our infrastructure. Wazuh analyzes logs and events from various sources, helping us detect and respond to security threats.

## AWS CloudWatch
AWS CloudWatch monitors our infrastructure, collecting metrics and logs from various services. It provides insights into resource utilization, performance, and overall health.

## Technical Demo Integration
In our technical demo, we showcase the following:

- AWS IAM: Demonstrating how IAM roles and policies are configured to enforce strict access controls.
- AWS CloudTrail: Showcasing how CloudTrail captures API activities and provides insights into our AWS account's actions.
- Wazuh: Illustrating how Wazuh monitors and alerts us about security events, enhancing our threat detection capabilities.
- AWS CloudWatch: Displaying how CloudWatch monitors resource metrics, log data, and custom events, helping us maintain a healthy infrastructure.

## Conclusion
Our AWS infrastructure architecture is designed to ensure a resilient, secure, and efficient cloud environment. By integrating various components like VPC, EC2 instances, IAM, CloudTrail, Wazuh, CloudWatch, VPN, and S3 buckets, we achieve a comprehensive solution that meets our operational and security needs.
