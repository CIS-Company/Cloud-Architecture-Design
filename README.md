# Cloud-Architecture-Design

AWS infrastructure components, their interactions, and how they fit together.
All components must be labeled, and diagrams must be presentable (straight lines) and free of defects/typographical issues. Take your time to create a quality diagram; do not rush!
Clearly indicate AWS instances, networks, tools and services.
A clear, written explanation and justification of your cloud architecture design.
Add descriptions of how you incorporated these systems into your technical demo:
AWS IAM
AWS CloudTrail
Amazon GuardDuty
Include a table or chart of network infrastructure and configuration details (yes, this will overlap with your topology -- you must document your network in both ways):
Subnets and their uses
Include Subnet Masks, CIDR addresses, etc.
Security Group rules



Commit topology images and other visuals to the repo and link them on the README.md file.


System Diagrams
Create some initial diagrams of any aspects of your solution that you can plan at this stage. Examples include topologies, network diagrams and process flow charts.
Link these assets in your GitHub Documentation repo for review during daily stand-ups.
