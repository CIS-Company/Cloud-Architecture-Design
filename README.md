# Cloud-Architecture-Design

AWS infrastructure components, their interactions, and how they fit together.
All components must be labeled, and diagrams must be presentable (straight lines) and free of defects/typographical issues. Take your time to create a quality diagram; do not rush!
Clearly indicate AWS instances, networks, tools and services.
A clear, written explanation and justification of your cloud architecture design.
Add descriptions of how you incorporated these systems into your technical demo:
AWS IAM
AWS CloudTrail
Amazon GuardDuty
Include a table or chart of network infrastructure and configuration details (yes, this will overlap with your topology -- you must document your network in both ways):
Subnets and their uses
Include Subnet Masks, CIDR addresses, etc.
Security Group rules



Commit topology images and other visuals to the repo and link them on the README.md file.
