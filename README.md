# Cloud Architecture Design


(change to project definition)
AWS infrastructure components, their interactions, and how they fit together.
All components must be labeled, and diagrams must be presentable (straight lines) and free of defects/typographical issues. Take your time to create a quality diagram; do not rush!
Clearly indicate AWS instances, networks, tools and services.
A clear, written explanation and justification of your cloud architecture design.
Add descriptions of how you incorporated these systems into your technical demo:
AWS IAM
AWS CloudTrail
Amazon GuardDuty

(need to be included still)
Include a table or chart of network infrastructure and configuration details (yes, this will overlap with your topology -- you must document your network in both ways):
Subnets and their uses
Include Subnet Masks, CIDR addresses, etc.
Security Group rules



Link these assets in your GitHub Documentation repo for review during daily stand-ups.
